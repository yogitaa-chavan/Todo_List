# React Todo List

A simple Todo List application built with React, where users can add, delete, and manage their tasks. This project serves as a basic demonstration of state management and component-based architecture in React.

## How It Works

The React Todo List allows users to:
- Add new tasks to the list.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- View the list of tasks.

Each task is represented as an item in the list, and users can manage their tasks interactively.
